This is a basic lexical analyzer written in Java. Line by line, it reads a file containing source code, dividing each line into discrete tokens (words or symbols). Next, it classifies each token into one of many categories: numbers, identifiers (variables or function names), symbols (like "{", "}", "(")), keywords (like "if" or "while"), or unknown tokens. Lastly, it outputs the type of each token, its matching lexeme (the content of the token), and the line number in the source code where it appears. This is a useful tool for learning how the source code of a programming language is organized.
